# DSA210-Project
## Description
Kaan Akdemir(30970) DSA210 Term Project
## Motivation
I realized that I spend lots of my time on YouTube. I want to analyze how much time I spend on the platform and identify the categories I engage with the most. Additionally, I aim to observe my daily activity within these categories to better understand my viewing habits. Using this data, I plan to manage my time more effectively on YouTube and focus on watching more meaningful and productive content.
##Data Source
For this project, I heavily used two services to reach my data. Both were google's official services. I used Google Takeout and YouTube API from developers.google.com
##Plan
After I have collected the data from the sources, I will focus on cleaning and preprocessing it and ensure it is in a usable format for analysis. This will include parsing JSON files, taking key information such as video titles, timestamps, and categories, and cleaning up any inconsistencies or missing data. After that, I will perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizing the time spent on YouTube over different periods, identifying trends in my video preferences, and analyzing daily activity patterns. I will then uzse these insights to identify areas for improvement in my time management on YouTube, focusing on how much time I spend on productive versus non-productive content. Based on the analysis, I will develop strategies to optimize my YouTube usage and focus more on educational or meaningful content.
